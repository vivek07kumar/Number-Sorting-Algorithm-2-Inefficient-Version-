# Number-Sorting-Algorithm-2-Inefficient-Version-


This program works as follows -:

On every index we have to find the highest number on that list and exchange it with the number we were comparing with. If we keep doing this for every index then the list will be sorted from smallest to greatest. Finding the smallest number on every index will result in a list from greatest to smallest.
